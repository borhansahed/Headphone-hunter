The main times I would wear bigger headphones like this is either while working (inside), at an airport (inside), or on a plane (inside). Maybe I'm unique, but if I'm out and about, I'm definitely wearing earbuds, not big, bulky on ear cans.\r\n",

The noise cancellation is amazing as well. The sound quality I feel could be better for $200, but overall I'm satisfied.\r\n",

Verified they are authentic. Serial number on the right side can be registered with beats. All contents were included and box was sealed. Definitely legit!! Great purchase.\r\n",
